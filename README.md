# emoji-cli

`emoji-cli` provides input completion for emoji on the command line with an interactive filter.

## :memo: Description

Emoji (çµµæ–‡å­—, Japanese pronunciation: [emodÊ‘i]) are the ideograms or smileys used in Japanese electronic messages and Web pages, that are spreading outside Japan (ref: [Katy Perry - Roar (Lyric Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9SeJIgWRPk)).

Emoji are funny and make us want to use it :blush:. However, it is hard to use it on the command line. This is because the command line don't have input completion for emoji. Therefore, I developed this command line application `emoji-cli` with an interactive filter.

***DEMO:***
